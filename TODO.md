# OSN Project TODO

Progress tracking and deferred decisions. For full spec see README.md. For code patterns see CLAUDE.md.

## Current Status

`@osn/core` — full OIDC-style auth server: passkey (WebAuthn), OTP, magic-link, PKCE, JWT, OIDC discovery. `@osn/db` — users + passkeys schema. `apps/osn` — auth server entry point on port 4000. `@osn/client` — session expiry check, `handleCallback`. `apps/pulse` — auth callback handler, event CRUD UI, location autocomplete (with coordinate capture), Maps button on EventCard, toast notifications (solid-toast), double-click guard on delete; 59 component tests. `@pulse/db` — lat/lng columns + dynamic seed data. `@osn/api` — events domain fully tested with coordinate range validation. 119 tests passing across 10 files.

## Security Backlog

Address **High** items before any non-local deployment.

### High
- [ ] Open redirect in `/magic/verify`: `redirect_uri` not validated against an allowlist — attacker can steal auth codes — H3
- [ ] PKCE check optional at `/token`: silently skipped when `state` absent — make mandatory per RFC 7636 — H4
- [ ] No auth/authorisation middleware on API routes (OWASP A01) — H1
- [ ] No ownership check on mutating event operations (create/update/delete) — H2

### Medium
- [ ] Wildcard CORS on auth server — restrict to known client origins before deployment — M3
- [ ] No OTP attempt limit — 6-digit codes brute-forceable at HTTP speeds — M8
- [ ] All auth state in process memory (`otpStore`, `magicStore`, `pkceStore`, etc.) — lost on restart, unsafe for multi-process — M6
- [ ] `redirect_uri` at `/token` not matched against value stored in `pkceStore` during `/authorize` (RFC 6749 §4.1.3) — M10
- [ ] `/passkey/register/begin` accepts arbitrary `userId` with no auth check — M11
- [ ] Magic-link tokens use `crypto.randomUUID` without additional entropy hardening — M7
- [ ] `limit` query param in `listEvents` uncapped — guard `NaN` and clamp to 1–100 — M2
- [ ] Photon (Komoot) geocoding: keystrokes sent to third-party with no user notice — add consent UI or proxy — M1
- [ ] Pulse `REDIRECT_URI` falls back to `window.location.origin` — validate allowed redirect URIs server-side in `@osn/core`; already tracked as H3 — M12

### Low
- [ ] Tauri CSP is `null` — when tightened, allowlist `photon.komoot.io` (geocoding fetch) and `maps.google.com` / `www.google.com` (Maps links) — L7
- [x] `getSession()` returned expired tokens — fixed
- [x] OTP used `Math.random()` — replaced with `crypto.getRandomValues`
- [ ] `jwtSecret` falls back to `"dev-secret"` — throw at startup in production — M9
- [ ] OTP codes and magic link URLs logged to stdout — guard with `NODE_ENV` check — L5
- [ ] `imageUrl` allows `data:` URIs — add CSP `img-src` header — L1
- [ ] Sign-in page loads `@simplewebauthn/browser` from unpkg CDN without SRI hash — L6
- [ ] Failed OAuth callback leaves PKCE verifier in `localStorage` — clear on state mismatch — L2
- [ ] `REDIRECT_URI` derived from `window.location.origin` at runtime — prefer explicit env var — L3
- [ ] PKCE `state` not validated against a stored nonce — L4
- [ ] `jose` and `@simplewebauthn/server` use caret version ranges — pin to exact versions — L7
- [ ] Pulse `auth.ts` exports only public/build-time config — add comment discouraging secrets in that file — L8
- [x] `EventList` `console.error` logs raw server error objects — guarded with `import.meta.env.DEV` — L9
- ~~`@vitest/coverage-istanbul` uses caret version range — L10~~ dismissed: caret ranges are the project standard

---

## Performance Backlog

- [ ] Auth Maps (`otpStore`, `magicStore`, `pkceStore`, etc.) never evict expired entries — add periodic sweep — P1
- [ ] `new TextEncoder()` allocated per JWT sign/verify call — cache encoded secret or import `CryptoKey` once — P2
- [ ] `new TextEncoder()` allocated per `verifyPkceChallenge` call — move to module scope — P3
- [ ] `AuthProvider` reconstructs Effect `Layer` on every render — wrap with `createMemo` — P4
- [ ] `completePasskeyLogin` calls `findUserByEmail` redundantly — `pk.userId` already on passkey row — P5
- [ ] Duplicate index on `users.email` — `unique()` already creates one implicitly — P6
- [ ] Batch status-transition `UPDATE`s in `listEvents`/`listTodayEvents` (N individual writes today) — P7
- [ ] Eliminate extra `getEvent` round-trips in `createEvent`/`updateEvent` via `RETURNING *` — P8

## Deferred Decisions

| Decision | Context | Revisit When |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Messaging app name | Need a catchy name | Before public launch |
| Social media platform name | Need a catchy name | Before starting Phase 3 |
| Effect.ts adoption | Trial underway in `packages/api` | After more service coverage |
| Supabase migration | Currently SQLite | When scaling needed |
| Android support | iOS priority | Phase 3 |
| Self-hosting | Enterprise use case | Phase 3 |
| Payment handling | Deferred for Pulse ticketing | After core Pulse features |
| Two-way calendar sync | Currently one-way (Pulse → external) | Phase 2 |
| Community event-ended reporting | 15–20 attendees auto-finish; host notified | When attendee/messaging features land |
| Max event duration | Prompt user when creating events without endTime | When Pulse event creation UI is built |

---

## Future

### Phase 2: Polish
- [ ] Advanced discovery algorithms
- [ ] Venue pages with DJ schedules
- [ ] Recurring event management UI
- [ ] Calendar integration improvements
- [ ] Accessibility audit

### Phase 3: Expansion
- [ ] Social media platform (spec exists, implementation deferred)
- [ ] Android support
- [ ] Self-hosting capabilities
- [ ] Third-party API ecosystem
- [ ] Supabase migration (from SQLite)
